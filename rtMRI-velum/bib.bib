Hindi and American English speakers were asked to categorize/identify of oral/nasal consonants and oral/nasal vowels. There were no differences found in the [ba-ma] distinction, which was used as a control group because of the phonemic distinction in both language groups. Concerning the perception of a modified series of the vowel contrast [ba-ba~], English speakers required more velar port opening to label a vowel as nasalized. Speakers from both language groups required greater velopharyngeal coupling for perception of a nasal vowel than perception of a nasal consonant. With regard to nasal/oral vowel identification, Hindi speakers� discrimination was categorical, while American English speakers perceived the vowel distinction continuously.

LVP activity and acoustic signal were recorded from one native Hindi speaker producing monosyllabic, bisyllabic and polysyllabic real and nonce words in the carrier phrase /kya-ap d?ante h�~/. High and low vowels, and voiced and voiceless stops occurred in various positions in the words. Stops were produced with greater activity than the vowels. In stops, voiceless showed greater activity than voiced. In vowels, high vowels showed greater activity than low vowels. Activity during stops following high vowels was in general greater than during stops following low vowels; activity was greatest following nasals.

Using continua of synthetic stimuli created from adding a pole-zero pair to the spectrum of an oral vowel in the vicinity of F1, it was found that there were perceptual differences between English and Hindi speakers. The English speakers discriminated better between vowels at the non-nasal end of the continua for [? u] (and possibly for [i]). The Hindi listeners, but not the English listeners, showed a decrease in discrimination accuracy at the non-nasal end of the continua for the vowels [i u ?]. Both speaker groups showed similar discrimination functions for the vowels [e] and [o], with reduced discrimination at the two ends of the continua, a narrow peak for [o], and a broader peak for [e].

Standard Hindi description, used by educated speakers in cities such as Varanasi, Lucknow, Delhi, etc. Pronunciation differences among speakers of these cities are minimal.
Nasal consonants: /m, n, ?/ (some authors also include [?~] which occurs only in a few Sanskrit loans, but it is usually replaced by [n]. The velar nasal by and large only occurs before homorganic consonants except in a few Sanskrit loans. Palatal and retroflex nasal also occur before homorganic consonants and have been included in the list of phonemes by some authors.
Nasal vowels: there are 11 oral vowels (/i, ?, e, ?, �, u, ?, o, ?. ?/) of which the vowel [�] only occurs in English loans. All of these vowels except for [�] have distinctive nasal counterparts. Vowels are nasalized before nasal consonants.

One male native speaker of Hindi from Nagpur, in Uttar-Pradesh. 126 tokens. Nasal Coda Emergence was observed exclusively among the back (non-low) vowels, where it is more frequent in the mid-close vowel than in the high vowel. The high front vowel has greater MaxR(N) than the high back vowel. Back vowels generally have greater nasal flow than their front counterparts, except for [u~] and [i~]. The low vowel has greater MaxR(N) than the back and front vowels of the mid-close set.

Investigation of the temporal scope of nasal coarticulation and its dependence on segment type, syllable boundary, and word boundary in Hindi. Electromyograms were recorded together with simultaneous oral and nasal microphone recordings. It was found that (1) the effect of coarticulatory nasality stretches beyond two segments on both sides of a nasal -- vowel or consonants; (2) the temporal scope of coarticulatory effects was unrestricted by syllable or word boundary; and (3) left-to-right effects were as extensive as right-to-left effects.

There was some PG activity for all nasal and oral vowels of Hindi, increasing from front to back in varying degrees. LVP, the primary elevator and fixator of the velum, showed high levels of activity during all oral vowels. Also, LVP activity varied with tongue height (the heigher the vowel the greater the LVP activity). They cite earlier work (unpublished results; see Hend82) in which they found evidence that velar height also covaries with vowel height in both Hindi and English. PG showed a low level of activity for the front oral vowels, increasing with increasing vowel height. PG activity also increased with vowel height for central and back oral vowels. The authors interpret these high levels of activity for central and back vowels as being associated with the upward and/or backward movement of the tongue body during the production of these vowels.

PG was active and LVP was suppressed for all nasal vowels. While peaks of PG activity generally occurred at the same time (with respect to the vowel onset) in all nasal vowels, the timing of the PG activity onset with relation to the LVP activity offset was different between front nasal vowels and non-front (central and back) nasal (and oral) vowels. For front nasal vowels, the onset of PG activity and offset of LVP activity occurred at the same time (supports 'gate-pull' model). For the central and back vowels nasal (and oral) vowels, the PG activity onset began much earlier than the LVP activity suppression (does not support 'gate-pull' model). This suggests that the PG activity for the central and back nasal vowels was primarily associated with tongue body movement (as was also found for central and back oral vowels) and that the velic lowering for the nasal vowels was a 'by-product' of the PG activity.

EMG activity of the LVP and acoustic signal were recorded while a native Hindi speaker repeated 10 sVs nonce utterances, where the V is one of the 10 oral Hindi vowels. Preliminary results show that there is almost always some suppression of LVP activity for the vowel compared to the surrounding consonants, which seems to vary with tongue height: suppression progressively increases from high to low vowels. Between vowels of equal height, suppression for back vowels is somewhat less than front vowels.

Most of the /hVC/ strings that form real Hindi words have nasals or liquids in coda position. Due to the difficulty in segmenting these sounds from vocalic context and the strong coarticulatory influence that these sounds have on neighboring vowels, nasals and liquid coda words were not used in this study.

A reconsideration of the analysis of nasalization in Hindi by Narange and Becker (1971) (i.e. an analysis which assumes nasal vowels in Hindi to be underlying vowel + nasal consonant). There are more exceptions to schwa syncope than the N & B mention, and speakers are more frequently syncopating schwa before nasal vowels. In this respect, nasal vowels act like oral vowels, and should be considered as phonemic, not as underlying phoneticly nasalized vowels preceding a nasal consonant.

Using a gating paradigm, stimuli created from CV(C) CV~(C) and CV(N) syllable types in Hindi and English real words were presented to Hindi and English listeners. For the Hindi trisyllabic CV(N) condition, the majority response was CV~(C). For the Hindi doublet CV(N) condition, there was no significant difference between CVN and CVC responses. In the Hindi (and English) CV(C) conditions, the majority responses were correctly CVC.

A long nasal(ized?) vowel may be followed directly by a voiceless stop, but not by a voiced one; in the latter case a homorganic nasal consonant is produced. Morphemes containing long nasal(ized?) vowels followed by a homorganic nasal consonant preceding a voiceless stop are always part of the loan vocabulary. Short nasal(ized?) vowels (generally?) don't occur before obstruents. Nasographic data shows that: (1) velic opening is about the same for distinctive and non-distinctive nasalization; e.g. in words such as [kan] (non-distinctive nasalization) and [sa~s] (distinctive nasalization); (2) nasalization in Hindi seems to be predominantly anticipatory; e.g. the vowel in [kan] is more nasalized than that in [nak]. Additionally, the vowels in [kan] and [nam] (double co-articulation) had about the same degree of nasalization; (3) nasalization may pass through [r., w, y, h]. 

There are two different orthographic marks for a homorganic nasal (phonetic nasalization?) and for nasalization (phonemic nasalization?). There is some evidence that nasal vowels followed by a voiceless stop are becoming denasalized.

Schwa deletion in Hindi deletes the final schwa of a verb stem if the stem is followed by a vowel-initial suffix. However, schwa-deletion does not occure when the stem is followed by a nasal(ized) vowel. The author proposes that a syllable-based approach to phonological processes can account for both schwa syncope and vowel nasalization in Hindi. Furthermore, the author believes that nasal vowels in Hindi-Urdi are underlyingly sequences of oral vowel / nasal consonant.

	VOLUME = 48,
	PAGES = "149--179"}

Vowel 'height' is an integration of many different independent articulations, with no articulatory or acoustic priority given to the height of the tongue. All of the articulations involved (tongue root advancement, jaw height, lip protrusion and retraction, velic height, and vocal fold vibration rate) converge on a single effect: the manipulation of the 'perceived F1' (i.e. "the distribution of energy in the lower part of the spectrum, which contains the first resonance, as well as the acoustic effects of a variety of other articulations). (There is much quotable goodness on p.151 for work on integrated articiculations and their collapsed acoustic output!) 

Perception stimuli were created using a vocal tract modeling software (Vocal 2.1). F2 and F3 were kept constant, and only F1 was modified based on the vocal tract modeling for changes in tongue height. The resulting formants were used to synthesize vowels. Nasalization was synthesized by placing a nasal zero between the nasal and oral poles (the nasal pole was always 150 Hz lower than the oral pole). Pitch was manipulated directly. The results suggest that both nasalization and pitch are integrated with tongue height in the perception of vowels. Nasalization may be more of an independent attribute of vowels than pitch is. 

According the the results, Kingston believes that the many-to-one mapping of articulation onto acoustics is not a problem, but an advantage to the listener, since the objects of speech perception are not articulatory, but acoustic. In other words, the covariation of "additional" articulations along with tongue height are not spurious, and only serve to be ignored by the listener; rather, they work together with tongue height in order to achieve the same acoustic goals. Additionally, he claims that these articulations are all intentional... for example, the lower velic height of low vowels, traditionally assumed to be merely a mechanical result of tongue lowering, is rather an intended articulation with the acoustic effect of maintaining/enhancing the percept of a lowered tongue height.

A study on: (1) relation between vowel height and timing of velic opening before a nasal consonant, (2) relation between vowel height and timing of velic opening after a nasal consonant, (3) correlation between vowel height and velic height for both phonemic nasal vowels and phonetically nasalized vowels, and (4) the minimal time necessary to lower the velum before a nasal consonant. The study included speakers from American English (4), Swedish (3), French (3), Amoy Chinese (2), Hindi (1), and Brazilian Portuguese (1). Velic opening was measured using a nasograph. Vowel height and degree of nasalization correlate in the expected direction (higher vowels being less nasalized than lower vowels, when the vowel either follows or precedes a nasal consonant); exceptions include: American English, Swedish long vowels, and Hindi, where no significant differences were found between nasalization percentages between mid and low vowels. Velic lowering for low vowels in non-nasal environment was only found for American English. No difference found between nasal /i/ and nasal /a/ in Hindi. No difference found between any of the nasal vowels in French. Cross-linguistic evidence suggests that there may not be any minimal time necessary for velic lowering before a nasal consonant. Speakers of Swedish, Hindi, and American English. State of voicing in the final consonant affected velic closure timing, but there was little cross-language consistency. In general, velic lowering occurs later in the vowel production by the speakers of Hindi, French, Swedish and Amoy Chinese than by the speakers of American English and Brazilian Portuguese.
